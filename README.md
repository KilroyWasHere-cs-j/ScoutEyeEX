Simple, consistent, and designed for a mission.

## What is ScoutEyeEX

ScoutEyeEX is a complete rewrite of the legacy ScoutEye scouting system. ScoutEyeEX is still, with the exception of the initial configuration, completely internet independent.



## Cross platform support

ScoutEyeEX is build on top of the [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui). Now ScoutEyeEX can finally deliver on a truly cross platform FRC scouting experience.

### ScoutEyeEX currently supports

- Windows 11 and 10
- Android

#### Planned
- Web
- Linux

#### Possible support
- MacOS
- iOS


### Depreciation
This is no more; which would be sad, but now I can live in peace. Feel free to steal this code and do whatever you want to it. I will not be reviving this project so don't ask. Goodbye ScoutEye it was fun whilst it lasted.
